I have to admit, before diving into Ethereum, I had no idea how blockchain consensus mechanisms worked. 
I kept hearing about Ethereum’s “Merge,” but I didn’t fully grasp what it meant. So, I decided to do some research.

I learned that Ethereum used to rely on something called Proof of Work, which required miners to solve 
complex puzzles to validate transactions. It was energy-intensive and slow. Ethereum’s transition 
to Proof of Stake marked a huge change. Instead of miners, PoS relies on validators who put up a 
portion of their Ethereum, to secure the network. This makes it more eco-friendly and scalable.

The biggest thing I realized is that PoS helps Ethereum handle more transactions and is less wasteful. 
Validators are randomly chosen to create new blocks, and they earn rewards by validating transactions. 
But if they act dishonestly, they risk losing their stake. This design encourages good behavior and ensures 
the network remains secure without the environmental cost.
